## Week 06 \#MakeoverMonday

The week 06 is differnet from the others. There are no Data in provided in xlsx only in the Tableau foramts 
and the other other differece is that this week the chalange data are realy big . The source is the open data
Portal of Chicago. 

So I thougt: "ok even if I can not do a viz with that amount of data due to my limited computation capacity 
lets try to connect to the datasource and let see what I can do"

The conection itself turned out not that hard for small data buckets but I had some problems to load larger amount of data and with the count function.

you can find my tests in makeovermonday_W6.R
