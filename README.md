MakeOverMonday

This is my training repository. 

I am new to R and ggplot. I think the best way to get some practice is to use the tools. 
On my way throught the net I've found the #MakeoverMonday <http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/> site which provides once a week some 
data and a chart example on the internet. I've decided to do some of teh makeovers and store the results in this repository.
